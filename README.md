#Public Meeting Notes

This is a repository of public meeting notes!

I often find it difficult to aggregate thoughts, ideas, and minutes into a coherent summary of what actually happened at a meeting. This repository is an experiment to use version control and org-mode to organize notes from a meeting directly onto a webpage.

If nothing else, this is just an attempt for Luke to jot down his meeting notes in a somewhat organized fashion.

#How to contribute

These notes are taken in [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/). Just take the file, `index.org`, and run `M-x org-html-export-to-html` and your webpage is done!
